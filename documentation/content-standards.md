# Content Standards

There are two types of Codecademy Docs entries:

## 1. Entry

A normal entry is a detailed explanation of a coding concept. Think of them like short Wikipedia pages. Some of them are language-agnostic entries that fall in the "General" topic, while others are language specific entries that fall in topics like "C", "C++", "CSS", "Emojicode", and "Python".

General (language agnostic):

- [What is a Comment?](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/what-is-a-comment)
- [What is an IDE?](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/what-is-an-ide)
- [What is an Array?](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/what-is-an-array)

Python (language specific):

- [Lists](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists)
- [Conditionals](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/conditionals)
- [Dictionaries](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/dictionaries)

Some of these entries, such as the [Lists](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists) entry, will have a terms table at the bottom with more nested term entries.

## 2. Term Entry

Term entries are entries that covers a function, a method, a property, etc.

Inside Python's [Lists](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists) entry, there are a bunch of term entries in a terms table (scroll to the bottom):

- [.append()](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists/append) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/content/python/concepts/lists/terms/append/append.md))
- [.clear()](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists/clear) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/content/python/concepts/lists/terms/clear/clear.md))
- [.copy()](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists/copy) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/content/python/concepts/lists/terms/copy/copy.md))

## Components of an Entry

All Codecademy Docs entries are Markdown files and should consist of three parts:

- The **file name**, with the **.md** extension.
- The **content**, written in Markdown.
- The **metadata** about the content, written in YAML, which appears at the top of the entry.

We'll describe the standards for each of these components separately.

## Standards: File Name

The file name should be the title of the entry, in lowercase, with spaces replaced by dashes and punctuation removed, followed by **.md**.

To give an example, an entry titled "What is Three.js?" should have the file name **what-is-three-js.md**.

## Standards: Content

- All text should be written in Markdown
  - For more details on Markdown, see Codecademy's [Curriculum Markdown Style Guide](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/content-guidelines/markdown-style-guide/).
- Each subsection should begin with a heading of size h2 (i.e. preceded by `##`)
- All in-line code should be delineated by single backticks (`)

#### Code Blocks

Code examples are an excellent teaching tool. Many term entries will contain a code example as a standard field. Encyclopedia entries are more flexible, but if your encyclopedia entry doesn't contain any code blocks, take a moment to ask yourself if one would help!

All code blocks should be delineated by triple backticks (```)

- C: ```c
- C#: ```cs
- C++: ```cpp
- CSS: ```css
- Error: ```error
- Emojicode: ```emojic
- Golang: ```go
- HTML: ```html
- Java: ```java
- JavaScript: ```js
- Markdown: ```md
- PHP: ```php
- Plaintext: ```plaintext
- Pseudo: ```pseudo
- Python: ```py
- R: ```r
- Ruby: ```rb
- Sass: ```scss
- Scheme: ```scheme
- Shell/Program Output: ```shell
- SQL: ```sql
- Swift: ```swift

#### Codebytes: Runnable Code Blocks

Codecademy has a new feature called [Codebytes](https://www.codecademy.com/codebyte-editor) that will allow learners to click a button to run code blocks themselves! The output to the console will appear next to the code block.

Codebytes is a great tool to incorporate into some entries (for instance, if you want learners to to think about what a code block will output before they see it in action, or if you want to show a learner how a function that incorporates randomization produces different output each time).

The syntax is simple: You just add `codebyte/` between the ` ``` ` and the language name in the first line of a normal code block.

Here's an example for JavaScript:

````
## Codebyte Example

```codebyte/js
console.log('Hello, World!');
```
````

Currently, Codebytes is set to support the following languages:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- C++
- C#
- Go
- PHP

**Note:** Codebytes sometimes requires the code block to include some boilerplate code. To check what boilerplate is required for your language, select the language from the dropdown [in this demo page](https://www.codecademy.com/codebyte-editor). There you'll find a "Hello World!" program set up as an example!

## Standards: Metadata

| Variable Name    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Title`          | The title of the entry. This will be displayed on the page at the top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Title: "What is OOP?"                                                                               |
| `Description`    | A brief description (ideally under 150 characters) used in search engine results and content previews                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Description: "A brief description of OOP"                                                           |
| `Subjects`       | Languages and technical fields that the entry relates to. We're storing all of our Subjects in the [subjects.md file](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/subjects.md). Please only use Subjects from that list.<br /> - We aim to include an average of 1-2 subjects (and always at least 1!) with every entry.                                         | Subjects:<br /> - "Computer Science"<br /> - "Game Development"                                     |
| `Tags`           | Key words that are relevant to the entry. We're storing all of our Tags in the [tags.md file](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/tags.md). Please only use Tags from that list, but if that list feels insufficient, feel free to create a new Tag and add it to tags.md in your PR!<br /> - We aim to include an average of 3-4 tags with every entry. | Tags:<br /> - "React"<br /> - "URL"<br /> - "Strings"<br />                                         |
| `CatalogContent` | Slugs of Codecademy course and Path landing pages that relate to the entry.<br /> - Please avoid linking to individual content items, because their URLs may change and some are gated by Pro membership.<br /> - We aim to include 2 slugs with every entry (1 free course and 1 Pro course/Path).                                                                             | CatalogContent:<br /> - "introduction-to-javascript"<br /> - "paths/front-end-engineer-career-path" |

### General Writing Tips:

- Avoid referencing information that isn't strictly related to the topic of the entry. As a rule, you want to assume as little pre-existing knowledge as possible.
- Avoid using first- and second-person pronouns (e.g. I, we, you) if possible.
- Brevity without sacrificing clarity. Make every word count.
- If the concept is hard, make it easy. If it's dry, make it fun. If it's simple, keep it simple.
- 90% of writing is rewriting.

### File Hosting

If you'd like to include an image, video, GIF, or other file in your entry, please upload it to the [/media folder](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/tree/main/media). That way we'll never have any broken links!

### I've read all the content standards. Now what?
